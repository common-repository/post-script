Add important information to the bottom of your site with P.S.

== Description ==
P.S. is the easiest way to add important information to the bottom of your site. P.S. is a container block where whatever blocks you put inside of it will be displayed on your site as a popover. The only thing you are limited by is your imagination, all blocks are supported.

#### I like this, who made it?
This plugin is brought to you by [sorta brilliant](https://sortabrilliant.com/) and [block garden](https://block.garden).

== Screenshots ==
1. Add whatever blocks you want in the P.S. block.
2. Set up your button.
3. On your site P.S. generates a button.
3. And your popover automatically.
